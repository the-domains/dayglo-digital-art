DayGlo Digital Art My artwork is digital which means it's created from the use of computer programs, sometimes using more than one program at a time to induce a certain emotion. My art may take an hour to create, or it can take up to 3 days to get the right feel or look I want. 

It's Space age, Light, Spiritual, and very Personal art. I hope you enjoy feeling my art and hearing the music I've tried to create with it.

In a few months since this is a beta test, I hope once it's live in the near future I will have my art for sale here.

If you see something on my FB page and would like to purchase it framed send me a message and we can talk.

Thank you for checking it out.
